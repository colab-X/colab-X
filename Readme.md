# Collab X - The Future of Creative Collaboration 👥

### Live Deployment (Fully OnChain): [Collab X](https://collab-x-lake.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 Overview

**Collab X** is the ultimate platform for creators who dream big but lack the time, skills, or equipment to bring their ideas to life. Whether you're an artist, a writer, or an entrepreneur, Collab X helps you connect, collaborate, and monetize your creativity through our social network and instant crowdfunding solutions.

**Our mission** is to empower dreamers and creators by providing the tools to:

- Post and share their creative projects.
- Recruit collaborators to co-own and co-create.
- Generate revenue and rewards through shared ownership (NFTs, tokens, credits).

### 🌟 What we built

Collab X is built on Kinto App (Layer 2) and integrates advanced AI solutions for creative content generation and collaboration. We utilized **Gabriel** for AI editing and agent systems, allowing creators to enhance their work effortlessly. Our platform allows seamless collaboration, encouraging individuals and corporations to discover the next big media project while sharing ownership and profits.
